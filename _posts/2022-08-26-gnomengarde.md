## Exploring Phandalin

The next morning, the party get an early start as they are keen to explore more of Phandalin.

Overnight, Merry spent some time identifying some magical objects that were found, and discovered that:

- The red gem contains 3 copies of the spell **Aid**.
- The spell that was found is the legendary **Fireball**.

After first breakfast they visit the townmaster, who pays 15g for the bugbear ears (after some haggling) and suggests that the party visit the Quest Board in the centre of town. Upon visiting this, they see several advertisments by the townspeople who are in need of hired help. After some discussion, they agree to take on the following quest:

```
GNOMENGARDE

A clan of reclusive rock gnomes resides
in a small network of caves in the
mountains to the southeast. The gnomes
of Gnomengarde are knownfor their
magical inventions. They might have
something with which to defeat the dragon. 

Get whatever you can from them.

If you bring back something useful and
don't want to keep it for yourselves,
Townmaster Harbin Wester will pay you
50gp for it.
```

Next, the party visits the Miner's Exchange, a place where adventurers can buy and seel prospected ores and gems. This is a single floored, wooden building just to the south of the main town square. Inside they meet the owner Halia Thornton, who tells them `I DIDNT WRITE THIS DOWN WHOOPS`.

After chatting for a bit, they head back to the Inn for Merry's second breakfast, and to gather their supplies for the day. In exchange for a generous tip, the barkeep tells the party about Halia, and explains how she's angling for the Townmaster's job when he's gone. He explains that she doesn't have anything against him, but she's full of ambition - as all members of the Zentrim are. He also gives some useful information about the gnomes; they call themselves wizards, but they're no more than tinkerers, and anything they invent that is actually useful is pure luck.

## To Gnomengarde

It takes 3 hours to get to Gnomengarde. The settlement is carved out of sheer cliffs on either side of a narrow waterfall, feeding into a pool in which sit two small islands covered in 2â€‘foot-tall blue, green, and purple mushrooms. The mist and roar of the waterfall blankets and hides the area from outsiders. As they get closer, Merry senses a slightly distored reality, and realises that any magic spells cast may behave in slightly unpredictable ways.

Following a small path up the cliff face, the party find themselves in a bustling kitchen. Five gnomes are set about cooking; squeezing oil from mushroms, kneading huge balls of green bread dough, and stuffing mushrooms into the dough.

After some introductions, the gnomes explain that they need help. One of the gnomes claims that their friend has gone missing, probably eaten by a ghost a few days prior. The other gnomes contradict him, and say they're just on holiday. They do agree that the last place this gnome was seen was in the barrel room. The gnomes also mention that the two kings who rule Gnomengarde are missing! They normally can be found in the throne room, but no one has seen them for days.

Eager to help, the party head towards the barrel room to look for clues. Walking through the caves they enter a room which has a strange noise coming from it. It turns out to be a massive rotating platform with chairs mounted on top, and sat in one of the chairs is a female gnome aiming a dangerous looking crossbow at the party. The gnome is shouting something about ghosts.

In typical dwarf fashion, Hariharn doesn't think too hard or too long before stepping forwards and smashing the crossbow to pieces with his warhammer. The gnome jumps down from the platform and continues gibbering about her friend being taken by ghosts. The party sidle past her and into the adjacent barrel room.

They don't find anything odd here - the room has barrels around the edge of the room, with spigots attached to them all, no sign that any ghost abductions happened. Continuing being a stereotypical dwarf, Hariharan tastes some of the booze, which turns out to be a horribly alchoholic, bright green mushroom wine.


## Pog & Ula

<!-- Leave room, continue toward throne room, but guarded by gnomes on 10ft high ledge, rock gnomes on it
- "who goes there, king said to kill anyone who comes in" !-->


`FILL THIS IN I DONT KNOW HOW WE GOT TO GNOMES OR THE ROPE BRIDGE`

These gnomes introduce themselves as `Pog and Ula`. They haven't seen any ghosts, and there are no gnomes missing as far as they're aware. They tell the party that the Kings can be found across the rope bridge just outside.

The rope bridge stretches across the water 20ft below, with the waterfall falling just off to the side making a lot of noise. Taegen nimbly crosses the bridge, and reports that on the other side is a room with two deadly spinning blades, with no apparent way to cross. Enna spots a switch on the far wall, and Merry casts Mage Hand to press it, which deactivates the blades for long enough for the entire party to make it across the room and through a door on the far side.

In this room they are greeted by the sight of two more gnomes, deep in argument. They seem to be trying to decide how best to "cure" the King's madness. One is claiming that he can build a sufficiently safe Sanity Ray Gun and blast some sense into the King, while the other argues for a more traditional unescapable straitjacket. They ask the party to pick which one they think would be best. Eventually they are persuaded away from both of these options, and agree that if a more humane solution can be found then the finder of such a solution may be allowed to choose a reward from the Gnomen treasury.

# Two Kings

The throne room consists of two thrones made of scrap metal. Hariharan notices that the thrones are a little bit further away from the wall than one might expect, and informs the party. After searching around for a bit, they are unable to find anything out of place, so leave the throne room to look for the Kings. They follow a short passage, come across a shimmering wooden door, and knock. The Kings have locked themselves in their bedroom! One of the Kings `NAME!` says that the other `MORE NAME` is terrified of the tentacle monster returning, and has ordered the guards to kill anyone who comes near just in case it's the monster in disguise. They say that they were attacked while in the throne room (`SOMETHING ABOUT A RUG?`).

The party return to the two tinkering gnomes and ask if there's anyone else they could ask about the going-ons. They're directed down a short flight of stairs into a chamber where there are 10 sleeping gnomes. One-by-one they are woken up and interviewed.

The stories vary wildly. Most agree there are missing gnomes, some say they're on holiday, others say they were eaten by ghosts, one even says it's the work of dark magic. A couple are totally incoherent. While talking to one of the Gnomes, they say something which triggers an old memory in Merry. She remembers stories of a mystical  creature called a Mimic, a tentacled monster which is able to shapeshift in order to hide and trick, often taking the form of a chest to lure in unsuspecting adventurers.

With that in mind they go in search of it.


## The Mimic

After searching around a bit, they eventually wind up back in the barrel room. This is the room where one of the gnomes was last seen. The party notice a new barrel - one that wasn't there before. It's away from the wall, and is missing a spigot. They suspect it could be the mimic in disguise.

Lance creeps up and attacks the barrel. As soon as his sword makes contact, it jumps back, and tentacles burst out of the top. Taegan stabs it with his rapier, and gets chomped in return, injuring him quite badly.

Enna casts Guiding Bolt, which seems to hurt the creature. Lance slashes at it, Hariharan smashes with his warhammer, and eventually the mimic succumbs to the damage and is defeated.

The party find 90s in coins and slice off some tentacles as proof for the Kings.
