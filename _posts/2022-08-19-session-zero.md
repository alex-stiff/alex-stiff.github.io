## The adventure begins

A once prosperous city, Phandalin was destroyed and ransacked by Orcs in the late 10th century, and subsequently abandoned. Five hundred years later, it has been resettled by farmers and prospectors, and now acts as a frontier town for adventurers visiting the Sword Coast North. Its population consists primarily of humans, elves, halflings, and dwarves, although most of the dwarves live and work in the mines just outside town.

## Prisoners

The five adventurers wake up to the sound of crying. Lying on the cold hard stone floor in seprate cells of a rather flimsy looking prison, they see two ugly green skinned goblins dragging a young girl out of the room. The adventurers don't know each other. One minute they were traveling to Phandalin in search of work, knowledge, and coin, and the next minute they were here in this prison. They don't know how they got here, but they do know that they need to get out before the goblins come back.

Lance, a heavily muscled human, wastes no time and leans his weight against the cell door and pushes it open. In the adjacent cell, the Elven rogue Taegen takes a more subtle approach and quickly picks the lock to get himself out using a lockpick that he had hidden away.

The stout dwarf Hariharan takes a run up and charges head first into his door, hitting it with such force that the whole row of cells all spring open, freeing both Enna, another elf, and Merry, a cheerful looking halfling. They grab their weapons and equipment that were handily left in a big pile by the door, and proceed in persuit of the goblins.

Entering the next room, torches along the wall reveal a stone table with strange carvings on it. Hariharan recognises the marks in the stone, and tells the party that the table is a sacrificial offering table of human design, looking suspiciously at Lance as he does so. One side of the room is piled with rubble and rocks, covering what used to be an entrance, blocking the way. The only other out is a door on the opposite side of the room, which leads to a narrow corridor which curves around to the right.

As the party approach the end of the corridor, they see another door, with muffled voices coming from behind it. Getting closer, they are able to make out that it's the two goblins bickering.

"...heavier than they look, dwarves. And don't get me started on the human. At least the halfling and the girl don't weigh much. I'm sick of all this bagman work."

"You didn't even help. You made me drag the pointy ears all the way down here!"

Using their arguing as a distraction, Taegen quietly opens the door and attacks.

## Goblins

Taegen steps forward, nocking an arrow as he does so and firing directly at the closest goblin. Despite being right in front of him, the arrow flies past its intended target and smashes against the back wall. Lance runs forward and slices the goblin with his longsword, killing it instantly.

Seeing this, the second goblin turns on its heels and starts running towards the door at the far end of the room. Just as it reaches for the knob, a well-timed Sleep spell cast by Merry hits it in the back, causing it to immediately fall into a deep sleep. Taegen creeps over to the goblin, leans in close and slides his rapier into its chest, while simultaneously rifling through its pockets and stealing a small handful of copper pieces.

From underneath the door the goblin was running for, flickering torchlight and shadows can be seen. The party also hears a low chanting intermingled with whimpering, presumably from the girl that was dragged away. Enna peeks through the keyhole and reports that the chanting is coming from a gyrating goblin shaman dancing around a fire in the centre of the room. She also spots a table with some magical paraphernalia on it, and larger darker figure, but is impossible to make out exactly what it is against the brightness of the fire.

As the party discusses what to do the chanting reaches a crescendo, and for fear of anything bad happening to the girl, they fling open the door and burst into the room.

## The goblin king

The room is roughly square. In the centre of the room is a large burning bonfire, around which a goblin shaman is dancing. The creature is clutching a staff and wearing leather armour studded with steel. On the floor next to the fire is the girl, visibly hurt, with cuts and painted runes on her arms and face.

Behind the fire sits a Bugbear - a goblinoid creature covered in hair - holding a spiked morningstar and wearing hide armour. Upon seeing the adventurers it jumps up and engages the party.

Merry conjures three glowing blue bolts of energy which shoot towards the shaman and the bugbear. The shaman is hit hard, and stumbles, but the bugbear just seems annoyed. Taegen rushes in and finishes off the shaman by impaling it on his rapier.

The bugbear lumbers towards Merry for revenge, and swings his morningstar at her. Fortunately, he misjudges her size, and the weapon swings harmlessly over her head. Lance and Hariharan run in to help, Lance slashing at the bugbear's midriff while Hariharan lands a direct hit on its temple with his warhammer, killing it.

Merry searches a nearby table and discovers a spellbook on it, which she takes. During some downtime she'll be able to study it and learn the spells from the book.

Taegen presses the girl for information, and she reveals that she was out playing in the forest a few days ago when the goblins crept up and caught her and brought her to this tomb. She seems quite upset and tells the party she just wants to get back to her Dad in Phandalin, who is the local blacksmith.

Taegen remembers something he heard about Bugbear ears being worth a fair amount of money, so he slices them off and puts them in his backpack. The girl looks even more upset than before.

## The crypt

As the girl is being interrogated, Enna feels a slight breeze coming from the throne. She excitedly tells the party there might be a secret door underneath, so with the help of Lance and Hariharan, they push the throne aside revealing some stairs leading down. The stairs open into a long narrow room with stone shapes lining the walls. Above these reads:

**REVERED BY PHANDALIN**

The party realises that this is a crypt for fallen heroes. It looks old, so presumably these people have been buried here since before Phandalin was ransacked by the orcs. At the far end of the room there are steps upwards, with what looks like daylight filtering down. Above these stairs is another message:

**DANGER - TREAD LIGHTLY**

As the lightest of the party, Merry decides she'll test the waters. She steps out carefully into the room one step at a time, and after a few seconds reaches the other side safely. Hariharan follows just behind, but after a few steps one of the stones on the floor sinks slightly and there is a loud **click**. Just in time he spots a swinging axe appear from out of wall and jumps back, avoiding it. Him and the rest of the party make it across the rest of the room without any more traps being sprung, and head up the steps to freedom.

## Rendezvous

The party exit into a brightly lit forest clearing around mid morning, the exit they emerged from clumsily hidden by some bushes. As they emerge, they spot a man wandering around, obviously looking for something. He is wearing a toolbelt with hammers and other blacksmithing tools, and as soon as the girl sees him she runs over with a shout of "DADDY!". She tells him how she was saved, and the blacksmith introduces himself as Jack. He offers to lead the party the rest of the way to Phandalin. Along the way he gives them a rundown of the town, which shops are there, and what the people are like. He mentions that the mayor will pay well for Bugbear ears and to seek him out on arrival. As a show of thanks for rescuing his daughter, Jack presents the party with a mysterious red stone, which Merry is able to determine has some magical properties, but the specfics are unknown.

## Phandalin

Around midday, the party arrives in the frontier Town of Phandalin. Jack takes them straight to Stonehill Inn. He speaks with the Inn keeper and arranges room and board for one night, and gives 50sp to each adventurer for saving his beloved daughter, Jacqueline. Then he suggests checking the local merchants for supplies.

The party spends the afternoon perusing the merchandise of the local general goods store and coster, before returning to the Inn for a meal and a good nights rest.
